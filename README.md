# Checkout-Kata #
Hello! The Checkout-Kata challenge.

## Adding items 
Please add shopping items within Main.java to the basket object using the following format:

customerBasket.itemList.add(new Item("Apple", .50D, 'A' ));

## Adding/amending discounts 
You can add or amend discounts within the constructor of DiscountBuilder.java. If the convention is followed, the program will 
dynamically apply the entered discounts.
